# APU-Venue-Booking-App

APU Venue Booking System is a mobile application developed to streamline the tedious and manual process of booking or reserving venues like auditoriums, classrooms, tech labs, meeting rooms, and sports facilities to host events, club activities, group discussions or other purposes among APU students from the existing venue booking process. 

The developed system is partially completed and discusses the implementation of key features primarily focused on the user side.

Android Studio is used as the development platform to program the proposed system with Kotlin language and Jetpack Compose for UI composing. Google Firebase services such as Google Storage for image storage and image URL, and Firestore Database which serves as the systemsâ€™ database to manage user, booking, and venue data are used for the backend development of this system.
